🚀 Initializing GraphBasedCurriculumManager with 2000000 timesteps
📋 Experimental design: 100 baseline episodes, 50 episodes per intervention test
🏗️ Building intervention dependency graph...
🔧 Created intervention node: goal_basic with params: {}
🔧 Created intervention node: pose_position with params: {'positions': True, 'orientations': False}
🔧 Created intervention node: pose_orientation with params: {'positions': False, 'orientations': True}
🔧 Created intervention node: physics_friction with params: {'group': 'friction'}
🔧 Created intervention node: physics_mass with params: {'group': 'mass'}
🔧 Created intervention node: visual with params: {}
🔧 Created intervention node: random_full with params: {}
➕ Added node to graph: goal_basic
➕ Added node to graph: pose_position
➕ Added node to graph: pose_orientation
➕ Added node to graph: physics_friction
➕ Added node to graph: physics_mass
➕ Added node to graph: visual
➕ Added node to graph: random_full
🔗 Setting up dependencies:
   goal_basic → pose_position
⚔️ Setting up conflicts:
   physics_mass ⚔️ physics_friction
   pose_position ⚔️ pose_orientation
🧪 Intervention test order: ['goal_basic', 'pose_position', 'pose_orientation', 'physics_friction', 'physics_mass', 'visual', 'random_full']
✅ Graph construction complete: 7 nodes, 5 edges
